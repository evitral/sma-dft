## A. adv: smectic-isotropic, advection is on, BLM is computed through a PPE in Fourier Space

A1. cosAdvTrackMult.cpp

A2. cosAdvConSingle.cpp

A3. cosAdvConConics.cpp

A4. cosAdvConSameConics.cpp

A5. cosAdvConDifConics.cpp

A6. cosAdvDensity.cpp : probably something really wrong

## B. no-adv: smectic-isotropic, advection is off

B1. cosNoAdvConics.cpp

B2. cosNoAdvTrackBump.cpp

B3. cosNoAdvTrackMult.cpp

B4. cosNoAdvTrackSing.cpp

## C. quasi: smectic-air, quasi incompressible

C1. quasi.cpp : doesn't look right

C2. quasi-mass.cpp : better, focal conic

C3. quasi-test.cpp : perturbations from flat
